# dllfiles
main() calls functions from the dll files while exicution of .exe file.DLL files also call eachother.
 
 
 
   Run the exodll.exe ,enter any 2 numbers
   
   it will output the sum two times .first time by calling a function in dll1,second time by calling a function in dll2.when called first time the function in dll1 calls a function from dll2(the same function from dll2 which is called second time).

   it will again ask for two numbers and it will output the difference two times.
   
   first time by calling a function from dll2,second time by calling a function from dll1.when called first time the function in dll2 calls a function from dll1(the same function from dlll1 which is called second time).
