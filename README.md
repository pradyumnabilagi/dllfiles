main() calls functions from the dll files while exicution of .exe file.DLL files also call eachother.

  The namespace od dll2 is named as dllspec2.And the class declared in it is called dllclass2.
 
 
   Run the exodll.exe ,enter any 2 numbers
   
   it will output the sum two times .first time by calling a function in dll1,second time by calling a function in dll2.when called first time the function in dll1 calls a function from dll2(the same function from dll2 which is called second time).
